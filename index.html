    <h1>STD22 Service procedure Check list</h1>

    <h3>Ship:_______________________________Sphere no:________________________________Gyro no:________________________________</h3>
   
    
    <ol>
        <li>After checking with the Captain, start the gyro service by opening the top and front cover.</li>
        <li>Record all important gyro data (heading, gyro sphere current, temperature) manually by using dip switch next to the display, or use STD 22 service software to save a word file with complete gyro data.</li>
        <li>Switch off follow up system, take out outer sphere by first opening two 180 degrees opposite locker pins on the top of the outer sphere container and then opening the remaining two lockers while pushing outer sphere upwards into the spring force of the hinge. Place outer sphere next to the gyro.</li>
        <li>Check height of gyro sphere by dip stick. Height should be 1,5 to 2 mm.</li>
        <li>Switch off gyro completely by taking out the most left hand fuse on the connection pcb with a small screw driver.</li>
        <li>To allow gyro rotors to come to a complete stop, wait 20 min before handling the outer sphere.</li>
        <li>Disconnect green 12 pin connecter on the small terminal pcb.</li>
        <li>On a horizontal surface and check liquid level at the top center of the outer sphere. </li>
        <li>Check distilled water level by dip stick, take a sample of the distilled water by filling a syringe tipped with a short tube (in case distilled water is not clear like water and feels quite oily between your fingertips, there is a leakage problem with the float valve or the upper outer sphere shelf).</li>
        <li>Open all caps for liquids on top side of outer sphere container, dump liquid by slowly turning over the complete outer sphere at least twice until it is completely empty (Liquid is not harmful and can be disposed in to the wastewater systems with no extra precaution).</li>
        <li>Pull off the two big hoses at the pump while supporting the nozzles with the other hand. <br /> Pull off the small air release hose at the top of the pump.</li>
        <li>Unplug connector B3 and disconnect wire 6 on connector B2.</li>
        <li>Separate upper and lower outer sphere by unscrewing six cross slotted screws at outer diameter of outer sphere, lift up upper sphere, turn over and put it on the table.</li>
        <li>Use the suction cap to take the gyro sphere out of the outer sphere, place it on the table, prevented from rolling.</li>
        <li>Dry the inside of the outer sphere and the gyro sphere with lint free paper or micro fiber.</li>
        <li>Open the pump front end by turning it 45 degrees cw. Replace pump rotor and ceramic axle according to pictured procedure inside the service kit.</li>
        <li>Open bottom of lower outer sphere and check/clean for particles in the diffusor washer (If you find a white substance on the bottom, the plastic heater cover in the upper shelf is damaged and must be replaced).</li>
        <li>Put above parts back together with new gaskets arom service kit.</li>
        <li>Check all graphite resistances according to bulletin 9/2003. The amount of resistance tells you the condition of the gyro and which parts need to be cleaned very thoroughly or even replaced (All graphite resistances must be in the range of 10 to 15 Ohm. Gyro sphere graphite band can be 15 to 20 Ohms).</li>
        <li>Scrape the graphite with 3M scotch pad until you reach the above recommended resistance.</li>
        <li>Record sphere number, clean the sphere and complete inside of outer sphere with 50 degrees hot water and micro fiber. Flush the distilled water container with hot water at least twice.<br /> Sphere No:</li>
        <li>Hold upper half in horizontal position and check free movement of float valve. After lifting with a pen it must immediately fall back down valve. If it is stuck, replace upper shelf.</li>
        <li>Dry off all the parts, this can be done very good with a hair dryer, Do not use a hot air gun!!!</li>
        <li>After putting all caps back with new O ring, flush or wipe off with a clean sponge or microfiber rag each inside of the outer sphere halves and the gyro sphere using not more than 150 ml of the supporting fluid.</li>
        <li>Put new main gasket which seals upper and lower halves after stretching it a little bit. It must sit and stay in the lower groove with no tension at all. Put the gyro sphere inside lower half.</li>
        <li>Place top half into the correct position (pin and hole). Tie down upper half, only hand tied, no motor screwdriver.</li>
        <li>Reconnect the two hoses to the pump housing according to the labeling on the hose and pump.</li>
        <li>Connect wire 6 to Plug B2. Put plug B3 back into position.</li>
        <li>Fill the complete amount of distilled water into distilled water compartment using the black rubber funnel.</li>
        <li>Fill supporting liquid until one third of the center of the height indicator shows dark (If indicator is blind, overfill and subtract 30 ml using your tube tipped syringe again).</li>
        <li>Reconnect outer sphere to the hunge inside the gyro housing, watch for the pin guarded position and plug in B1 on the terminal pcb.</li>
        <li>Reconnect 24V, 10A fuse to power up the gyro. If QS relay is flashing and ship is not on anchorage, you can start the Quick Settling procedure (settling within 1h +-3 degrees) by shortly linking pin 2 and 3 of connector B5.</li>
        <li>After gyro is heated to 50 degrees C and QS is finished or has not been switched on, check height of gyro sphere with dip stick.</li>
        <li>Check heading and gyro sphere current and other important data manually by dip switch on the sensor pcb, or use STD 22 service software to save a word file with complete gyro data.</li>
        <li>Document your work and any irregularities in the service report and have it signed by the captain.</li>
